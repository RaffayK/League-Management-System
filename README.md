## Chapter 01: Introduction

### General

The Club Management System is a .NET-based software designed to manage various activities of a cricket club, including member registration, batch registration, and more. This system facilitates normal users to enroll for membership, log in to their accounts, and manage their activities efficiently. It automates daily operations, streamlining club functionality for ease of use.

## Chapter 02: System Analysis

### 2.1 Problem Definition

Current sports clubs often rely on paper-based records for student information and fee payments, leading to difficulties in maintenance, increased human effort, and a higher risk of errors. Additionally, match records need to be stored digitally for future reference.

#### Performance Requirements

- **User Friendliness:** The system should be easy to learn and use.
- **User Satisfaction:** The system must meet user expectations.
- **Error Handling:** The system should manage user errors without halting operations.
- **Response Time:** Operations should have minimal response time through efficient programming.

### 2.2 Proposed System

The proposed system, "Computerization of Sports Club (CSC)," includes two types of users: admin and regular users. Admins can add or modify user credentials. Users register by entering personal details, which are stored in the database. The system provides a login screen with options for staff login, player login, and registration. Once logged in, users can access player lists, upcoming tournaments, player details, fixtures, and more.

### 2.3 Software Requirements

- Windows 7 or above
- NetBeans 8.0.1
- Ucanaccess 4.0.4 (compatibility dependent)
